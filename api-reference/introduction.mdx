## Welcome

The Meetstream Bot API allows you to manage and interact with bots in meetings. 
API documentation can be built using [OpenAPI](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/openapi/setup) or [MDX components](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/mdx/configuration). 
This documentation uses an OpenAPI specification.

## Authentication

All API endpoints for the Meetstream Bot API are authenticated using API Keys.

Your API key must be included in the `Authorization` header for every request, prefixed with `Token `.

**Example Header:**
```
Authorization: Token YOUR_API_KEY
```

This authentication mechanism is defined in the `openapi.json` specification under `components.securitySchemes` and applied globally via the `security` definition:

```json
{
  "components": {
    "securitySchemes": {
      "ApiKeyAuth": {
        "type": "apiKey",
        "in": "header",
        "name": "Authorization",
        "description": "All API endpoints are authenticated using API Keys. The key should be included in the 'Authorization' header, prefixed with \'Token \'. Example: \'Authorization: Token YOUR_API_KEY\'."
      }
    }
  },
  "security": [
    {
      "ApiKeyAuth": []
    }
  ]
}
```

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key. You can manage your API keys from your Meetstream dashboard.
