## Authentication

All API requests require authentication via API Key. Include your API key in the `Authorization` header, prefixed with `Token`.

**Header Example:**
```
Authorization: Token YOUR_API_KEY
```

You can generate and manage your API keys from your Meetstream dashboard.

Authentication is defined in the OpenAPI spec as an `ApiKeyAuth` security scheme, applied globally to all endpoints.
