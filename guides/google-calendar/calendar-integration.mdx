# Google Calendar Integration Guide

## Overview

This guide will walk you through the process of integrating Google Calendar with MeetStream.ai.


# Step 1: Create MeetStream API Key

Create an api-key in the [MeetStream Dashboard](https://dashboard.meetstream.ai/api-keys).

# Step 2: Setup Google Calendar OAuth 2.0 Client

Setup the Google Calendar OAuth 2.0 Client by following the steps in the [Google Calendar OAuth 2.0 Setup](/guides/google-calendar/google-calendar-oauth) guide.

# Step 3: Implement OAuth 2.0 Authorization Flow

At this point you should implement the OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow in your system.
- Redirect the user to the authorization endpoint for a specific provider.
- Receive a callback from the provider on successful connect.
- Use the authorization code to retrieve a refresh_token. Refer to the [Google Calendar OAuth 2.0 Setup](/guides/google-calendar/google-calendar-oauth) guide for more details.

# Step 4: Create Calendar Integration

Create a calendar using the [/create-calendar](/api-reference/endpoint/post-create-calendar) endpoint.

At this point the bots will be automatiically scheduled to all the events linked to the google account. A list of the events will be available in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.meetstream.ai/calendars)
