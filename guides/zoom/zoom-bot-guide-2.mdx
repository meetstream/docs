# Zoom Bot Implementation Guide - Step 2

## Complete Zoom Bot Setup with MeetStream

Complete guide to implementing Zoom bots with MeetStream. Learn how to create your first bot, configure credentials, and handle common scenarios.
<Note>
  **Prerequisites:** Before starting, ensure you have created a MeetStream account and a Zoom app in Zoom's marketplace. If you haven't created a Zoom app yet, follow the steps in Step 1.
</Note>

<Warning>
  **Important:** At this stage, Zoom bots can only join meetings hosted by the user or organization that owns the Zoom app.
</Warning>

<Steps>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a bot">
    Use the Create Bot API to deploy your first Zoom bot. 

    <Card title="API Documentation" href="/api-reference/endpoint/post-create-bot" icon="book">
      For full API details, see the Bot API documentation
    </Card>

    **Endpoint:** `POST /bots/create_bot`
    
    Creates a new bot instance to join a meeting.

    **Authentication:** Requires API Key authentication (`Header: Authorization: Token YOUR_API_KEY`)

    <CodeGroup>
      ```bash cURL
      curl -X POST "https://api.meestream.ai/v1/bots/create_bot" \
        -H "Authorization: Token YOUR_API_KEY" \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{
          "meeting_link": "",
          "bot_name": "",
          "bot_message": "",
          "live_audio_required": {
            "websocket_url": ""
          },
          "live_transcription_required": {
            "webhook_url": ""
          },
          "custom_attributes": {
            "tag": "",
            "sample": ""
          },
          "callback_url": ""
        }'
      ```

      ```json Request Body
      {
        "meeting_link": "",
        "bot_name": "",
        "bot_message": "",
        "live_audio_required": {
          "websocket_url": ""
        },
        "live_transcription_required": {
          "webhook_url": ""
        },
        "custom_attributes": {
          "tag": "",
          "sample": ""
        },
        "callback_url": ""
      }
      ```
    </CodeGroup>

    **Possible Responses:**
    - **201:** Bot creation initiated successfully. Returns `{ bot_id: string }`
    - **400:** Bad Request (e.g., missing fields, invalid meeting link)
    - **401:** Unauthorized (Invalid API Key)
    - **500:** Internal Server Error

    <Tip>
      **Pro tip:** If a bot is denied recording permissions, you should signal this to the host to prevent lost recording opportunities. Set `recording_permission_denied_timeout` to automatically leave after 5 seconds if denied permissions.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="View your bot in the API Explorer">
    Monitor and debug your bot using the dashboard's Bot Explorer.

    1. **Access Bot Explorer**
       
       Navigate to the "Bots" section in your dashboard to access the Bot explorer

    2. **Find Your Bot**
       
       Locate the bot you just created and click the 'view' button to access detailed information

    3. **Debug and Monitor**
       
       Access bot details, debugging tools, live screenshots, and more to monitor your bot's performance

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Bot fails to join Zoom meeting">
    **Common causes:**
    - Meeting link is invalid or expired
    - Zoom app credentials are in development mode (only works for meetings hosted by app owner)
    - Meeting requires waiting room approval
    - Meeting has password protection not handled by the bot
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="No audio or transcript available">
    **Check these settings:**
    - Ensure audio is enabled in bot creation request
    - Verify meeting participants are speaking
    - Check if meeting host has enabled audio permissions for bots
    - Wait for processing time after meeting ends
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="API authentication errors">
    **Verify:**
    - API key is correct and active
    - Authorization header format: `Token YOUR_API_KEY`
    - Account has sufficient permissions
    - API quotas not exceeded
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
